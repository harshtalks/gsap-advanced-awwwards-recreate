                    One thing you should know about me is that I make dumb jokes
                    all the time because I, myself am a Dumb Joke

                  It all started with my interest in Web development (mostly
                  frontend) back when I was in 10th grade. Also School kills
                  your creativity, Yes it does. I used to make wordpress
                  websites for local ventures. Then one of my friends introduced
                  me to a local wed developer who helped me learn fundametals of
                  frontend development. He was cool and also very short. 10th
                  grader me was taller than him LOL.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the beginning, I wasn't so sure if I would actually love
                  the idea of leaving developer friendly experience wordpress as
                  a CMS provides and shift to the HTML and CSS. but then thanks
                  to cute websites I've got to see on awwwards and it really
                  fascinated me. I just wanted to explore every aspect of
                  frontend development. So this is how I got myself into the
                  world of Web Spaces. and most importantly, It does make me
                  happy because this is something I wanted to do and here I am,
                  doing what exactly I wanted myself to engage with.

                  Currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering in
                  Specialization with Business System, It's definitely going to
                  help me engross in internet business, the functions that drive
                  it while handling the technical domain. as I said, I code
                  too.I Started with C, C++, Data Structure and Algorithm and
                  now exploring python.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I love statistics too. I feel like this is the only branch of
                  mathematics which i embrace the most. Book titled as Naked
                  Statistics is the best I've ever read. Also this is the only
                  book I've read excluding every ncert book I was forced to
                  read. Imagine being in a cirlce where you're the only person
                  who knows how to get sexy things done, like making netflix
                  recommendation system most effective. predicition about United
                  States's wealth distribution in future. This is what makes you
                  look cool at the party.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Okay, I think I should shut up about my technical skills and
                  talk about myself a little more. So I like Indie Music,
                  something I talk about all the time. And before you ask what
                  is something that I like to do when I'm alone, It's a Slow
                  Dance on Niall Horan's Slow Hands . Bro that song still slaps.
                  I spend my time on social media a lot. I like talking to new
                  people. Omegle era was so much fun and I made so many
                  international friends. LOL I really don't know how could I
                  actually put that in more nicer way.
